# grover-sudoku-solver
Quantum Sudoku Solver: Using Grover's algorithm in Qiskit to solve 4x4 puzzles.

This project implements a 4Ã—4 Sudoku solver using Grover's search algorithm. The code uses Qiskit to build and run a quantum circuit that finds the valid solution from a set of candidate solutions.

## Project Structure:
- `sudoku-grover.py`: Contains the main code for setting up the puzzle, constructing the oracle and diffuser, running Grover's algorithm, and outputting the valid solution.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages.
- `LICENSE`: The license file for the project.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.7+
- Qiskit
- NumPy
